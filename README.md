Longboye is currently a Haskell import statement prettifier.

Pass it one or more paths to filenames or directories on the command line and
it will process each file (when given files), or each `.hs` file in each
directory (recursively, when given directories).

The [examples/](examples/) directory shows an example of many different imports
pulled from open source projects.  For examples of real-life layout in context
in one project, see the Longboye source code.  Longboye eats it's own dog
food. üê∂

## Data Integrity

The operations are performed by:

- making a temporary backup of the file in the same directory as the original
- writing the new content to a temporary file in the same directory
- atomically swapping the temporary file into place
- deleting the backup file

This should provide a relativel high degree of safety.  If Longboye does detect
an error it will abort all operations leaving the backup file in the same
directory with a `.longboye.bak` extension.

## TODOs

- [ ] Bonus as/hiding/other collapses
- [ ] Solicit Feedback
- [ ] Clean up UX/ergonomics/polish.  eg. something better than "Processing file: ..."
  - [ ] add -q to prevent output other than errors
